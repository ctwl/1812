Our Final project for Art && Code && Interactivity. An HTML5 game combining CreateJS with Box2d and WebRTC to do some pretty cool things. First, you open or join a channel to start the game. You get to shoot cannonballs at circles by holding the mouse down to fire. You can also join a channel to play a multiplayer instance with or against people, no servers, no nothing, just peer to peer gameplay.
